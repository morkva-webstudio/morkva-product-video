Add an MP4 video to WooCommerce product gallery, make your products stand out. Very simple to use.

== 👉️ Description ==

Morkva Product Video lets you attach an MP4 video to any WooCommerce product - simple, fast, and theme-friendly integration:

✅ MP4 video field per product (supports relative or absolute URLs to files hosted on your site).

✅ Thumbnail is always placed second in the gallery (position control is read-only in free).

✅ Basic playback preferences (Autoplay / Loop / Mute at start).

✅ Works with popular themes (incl. Flatsome, Storefront, Block themes).

✅ Lightweight and Performance-friendly: the gallery still loads its images as usual; the video uses preload="none".

Need catalog autoplay previews and advanced behaviors (e.g., single page autoplay that replaces the main image, or choosing last position in gallery)? Check out the Pro version.

**Why self-hosted MP4?**

* Widely supported by browsers.
* Keeps shoppers on your product page.
* No third-party embeds or tracking pixels.

**What this plugin does not do**

* It does not embed YouTube/Vimeo.
* It does not autoplay previews in the catalog (Pro).
* It does not change the main image automatically (Pro).
* It does not store or use external thumbnail URLs (thumbnail must be an attachment).


== 👉️ Installation ==


1. Upload the plugin folder to /wp-content/plugins/ or install it via Plugins → Add New.

2. Activate Morkva Product Video.

3. Go to Products → Edit any product → Product data → Product Video:

* Click Upload / Select Video and choose an MP4 file hosted on your site.

* Click Upload / Select Thumbnail and choose an image from the Media Library.

* Update the product.



== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Which video formats are supported? =
MP4/H.264 is recommended and used by default. Other containers/codecs aren’t guaranteed across all browsers. Keep bitrates modest for fast playback (e.g., 720p–1080p, 3–8 Mbps).

= Can I use an external image URL as the thumbnail? =
No. The thumbnail must be selected from the Media Library so that WooCommerce can inject it into the product gallery.

= Where does the thumbnail appear? =
In the free version it’s always the second gallery item.

= Does this affect Core Web Vitals? =
The plugin sets the video to preload="none". The gallery images load as usual; video bytes are not fetched until needed. For best results, keep your thumbnail optimized and sized similarly to product images.

= Will it work with my theme? =
It works with most themes that use the standard WooCommerce gallery hooks. We’ve tested with Flatsome, Storefront, and block-based themes. If your theme replaces the gallery entirely, results may vary.

= Does it support variable products? =
Yes—the video is attached to the product (not to variations). If you need per-variation videos, that’s custom work.

= Can I autoplay in catalog or swap the main image automatically on the product page? =
Those enhanced behaviors are Pro features.
